    h1#welcome Welcome

    p
      | Thanks for checking out StopLight. These docs are very much a work in progress. If you have a question that is not covered here, please shoot me a note
        on twitter
      a href='https://twitter.com/stoplightio' target='_blank' = ' @stoplightio'
      | !

    h2#welcome-start Getting Started
    p
      | First things first. Do you have an account yet? If not, head over to
      a href='http://stoplight.io' = ' StopLight.io '
      | and request an invite. Invites are sent out often.
    p
      | If you do have an account, login at
      a href='https://dash.stoplight.io' target='_blank' = ' the StopLight.io dashboard '
      | and proceed below!



    h1#apps
      i.fa.fa-cube
      | Apps
    p
      | To create an app, click the + button in the top right of the Apps pane.
    h2#apps-variables Global Variables
    p
      | Global variables are variables that can be set on a per environment basis. Define them in your app, and then set them when you setup your environments.
        These variables can be used anywhere, in any request or test script. An example of a global variable might be an apiKey for an external service, that depends
        on the environment.


    h1#environments
      i.fa.fa-cloud
      | Environments
    p In StopLight, all requests and test runs are scoped to an app and environment. You can create as many environment as you want per app.
    h2#environments-setup Setup
    p
      | Once you've created and selected an app, you should see a menu item in the left nav named "Environments". Click this, and then click the + button at
        the top of the environments pane that appears on screen. This will create a new, blank environment for your app. Give it a name, and then set it's base URL.
        You might want to create several environments, one for testing and one for production for example, that live at different base URLs.
    h2#environments-variables Global Variables
    p
      | Global variables are defined on an app, as described above. You can set global variables to values appropriate for each environment. These variables are
        available in requests and tests using the SL.variables system. More on that below.
    h2#environments-local Local Environments
    p
      | To setup a local environment, please follow the instructions available at the
      a href='https://github.com/marbemac/stoplight-cli' target='_blank' = ' StopLight CLI Tool '
      | repository. Once you've setup your local environment, it will show up in the list of environments like any other.


    h1#endpoints
      i.fa.fa-cloud-download
      | Endpoints
    p Endpoints represent individual HTTP resources in your API or app.
    h2#endpoints-setup Setup
    p
      | Once you've created and selected an app, you should see a menu item in the left nav named "Endpoints". Click this, and then click the + button at
        the top of the endpoints pane that appears on screen. This will create a new, blank endpoint for your app.
    h2#endpoints-uri-params URI Params
    p
      | Often APIs routes include dynamic parts, for example an endpoint /users/marc and /users/john. In your application you might define this route
        as /users/:username. In StopLight, if you would like to define a parameter in the URL itself, just wrap it in {brackets}. So, the URL above would be
        described as /users/{username} in StopLight. You can include multiple URL parameters in one endpoint URL definition.

    h2#endpoints-variables Variables
    p
      | The StopLight variable system is quite flexible. You can assign persistent variables from endpoints and tests, and use these values to build other
        requests.
    P
      | To assign a variable from an endpoint request, click the + button next to the "Variables" section on the endpoint edit pane. Anything in the request
        is available to assign. Most of the time, you will be assigning values from SL.body, which is the body of the request response (what is returned from
        your API). So, if your API returns a JSON response of the form {token: "123"}, you could create a variable called authToken and make the value equal to
        SL.body.token. Whenenever a request is made for this endpoint, it will save this variable if possible. SL.variables is a JSON
        object, so you can nest variables if you wish. For example, you could assign two variables, one to user.name, and another to user.email, and it will
        create the appropriate structure.
    img src='/img/endpoint-variables1.png'
    p
      | You can use variables pretty much anywhere. For example, to build a URL using a variable SL.variables.username, just define the url as something
        like /users/{username}, and then put SL.variables.username as the default value for that URL parameter. If the value for that variable is present,
        it will be used to create the URL when you make a request. If you need to use variables in a header, wrap the variable in {brackets}, for
        example "Basic {SL.variables.authToken}".
    p
      | If present, variables will auto-fill your request info for you. You can always erase the auto-filled values and use your own if you choose.
    img.full-width src='/img/endpoint-variables2.png'
    h2#endpoints-requests Requests
    p
      | To make a request, you must first have an active environment. In the top nav, select an environment from the dropdown. Then, navigate to an endpoint
        and click the "Make Request" button. Once the request is completed you can browse all of the data associated with the action.
      b = ' Anything in the SL object (SL.request, SL.body, SL.response, etc) is available when assigning variables, and in your test scripts.'
      | A request history is available for each environment.
    img src='/img/endpoint-requests.png'


    h1#tests
      i.fa.fa-flask
      | Tests
    p Tests allow you to make requests against your endpoints in a particular order, under a variety of conditions and requirements.
    h2#tests-setup Setup
    p
      | Once you've created a few endpoints, click the item in the left nav named "Tests". You should see your available endpoints listed here. Drag
        and drop the endpoints to adjust the order in which they're tested.
    h2#tests-script Scenarios
    p
      | Scenarios let you test an endpoint under a variety of conditions. For example, you might want to create one scenario to test wether providing
        an inappropriate email address to the userCreate endpont returns a status code 400, and another scenario to test that it returns a user when sent valid
        parameters.
    p
      | If you do not fill in values for your parameters, the default values assigned in the endpoint definition will be used. They default values are shown as
        light placeholder text on the inputs, as shown in the image below for phoneNumber and countryCode.
    h2#tests-script Writing Test Scripts
    p
      | Test scripts are written in javascript, and have full access to the SL object. The SL object has an array named tests (accessed through SL.tests). Simply
        assign anything that can be evaluated to a boolean to SL.tests['name of my test'] and it will be added to the scenario's tests. You can also assign variables
        dynamically in test scripts, for example SL.variables.foo = 'bar';
    p
      b To run your full test suite, click "Run Tests" in the top navigation. The button is only present if you have an app and environment selected.

    h1#faq FAQ
    h3 Is StopLight Free?
    p
      | For now, yes (and no credit card required)! StopLight is completely free while in beta. I want to get feedback from as many users as
        possible before making decisions on pricing. That said, there will always be a free "tier", and I will give at least 2 weeks notice
        before StopLight goes out of beta. I look forward to working with everybody to create a truly useful API tool.
    h3 What about API authentication, and team support, and X,Y,Z?
    p
      | It's coming! If you are particularly excited about a feature please do let me know on Twitter
      a href='https://twitter.com/stoplightio' target='_blank' = ' @stoplightio.'
      | It's good to know what's important to people.
    h3 How secure is StopLight?
    p
      | All data is sent over SSL. This includes the StopLight API itself, the Dashboard, and the CLI tool.
    h3 More questions?
    p
      | Ask ask away on Twitter and I'll add them here!
